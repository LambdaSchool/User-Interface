            <p>Innovate Today exists to provide your business with modern
              solutions to the problems that plague every entrepreneur. 
              We will connect you with customers by utilizing social media,
              search engine optimization, and other internet marketing methods.

            <h2>About</h2> 
            
            <p>Daniel Wallen, CEO of Innovate Today, became motivated to
              start this business when he saw how much everyday entrepreneurs
              struggle in our digitized world. Posting flyers can only get you
              so far. It'd be wiser to chart a course on the social media landscape.

            <h2>Testimonials</h2> 
            <p>"Daniel Wallen is one of the more interesting people I've ever met.
              He gave me several movie ideas that I can't wait to explore. One of them
              will be even bloodier than Kill Bill. It will definitely put Pulp Fiction
              to shame (which says a lot in my opinion)."<br>

            <h2>Vision</h2> 
            <p>Imagine a world where you never have to hunt for a new client or 
              customer again. Instead, you'll have systems that drive targeted leads
              to you while you sleep. This isn't a pipe dream. It's a tangible reality
              that can become yours today. Contact us to get started.
              I promise you won't regret it!
