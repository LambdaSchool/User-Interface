Part Two:
Go back and follow the same steps for your UI-III-Flexbox project and your User Interface - Great Idea Project.
In order to do this, you do not need to create new forks of these projects. Follow the steps below for each project:
*  Add your PM as a collaborator to your fork.
*  Go into your project folder, make a new branch firstname-lastname
*  Add your first and last name to the README.md file in the project and save.
*  add/commit/and push to your own branch Be sure to push to your branch!
*  Create a Pull-Request to submit your work
o  Use your own student fork as the base (compare across forks, base-fork -> master).
o  Add your PM as a reviewer on the Pull-Request
*  PM then will count the Assignment as done by merging the HW back into master "STUDENT FORK".
